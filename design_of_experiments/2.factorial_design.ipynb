    "# Factorial Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Factorial Design is a powerful experimental design technique used to study the effects of multiple factors and their interactions on a response variable. It is widely used in various industries, including technology, to optimize processes, improve products, and make data-driven decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Factorial design is superior to the One-Factor-at-a-Time (OFAT) approach, where only one variable is changed while keeping others constant. OFAT fails to identify interactions between factors, leading to incomplete insights and inefficient experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By testing multiple factors simultaneously, factorial design allows FAANG companies to optimize user experience faster, reduce experimental costs, and uncover hidden relationships that OFAT would miss. This ensures smarter data-driven decisions that enhance product performance and engagement."

    "## 1. Definition of Factorial Design\n",
    "**Factorial Design** is an experimental setup that involves two or more factors, each with two or more levels. The design examines all possible **combinations of factors and levels**, allowing researchers to study not only the **individual (main) effects** of each factor but also the **interactions between factors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Factorial design is not just about finding the best combination of factors; its deeper purpose is to **optimize user experience while minimizing costs** and **computational resources**. By understanding main effects and interactions, companies like Google and Netflix can enhance engagement, improve performance, and drive business growth without unnecessary trials, ensuring a data-driven decision-making process. \n",
